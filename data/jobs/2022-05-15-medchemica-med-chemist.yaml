summary: |
  [MedChemica](http://www.medchemica.com) is leading the optimisation of new antiviral agents within the ASAP antiviral drug discovery (AViDD) Center. Within our team, we analyse biological and ADMET testing data, and combine that with protein-ligand structural data, FEP calculations and machine learning methods to both design and prioritise compounds for synthesis.  As a member of the lead optimisation team, you will work closely with teams of synthetic chemists, other medicinal chemists, computational chemists, virologists, pharmacokineticists and physical chemists to make sure the best compounds get made and tested.  The lead optimisation team is central in delivering the overall Center goals of generating new anti-virals for human trials ready to treat future pandemics.  You will be working within MedChemica Consultancy Limited where you will be a supportive and supported team member, and where you will also have opportunities to contribute to the development of new AI tools for medicinal chemistry.

  What weâ€™re looking for:
  * With a PhD and /or post doctoral experience in medicinal, synthetic or physical organic chemistry, you are confident in relating organic chemical structures to their properties and synthesis,
  * A desire to learn medicinal chemistry for small molecule drug discovery,
  * An interest in learning virology and human biology in order to work with our biology and ADMET colleagues,
  * An enthusiasm to apply modern methods in computational chemistry to accelerate drug discovery,
  * Great team working skills for collaborating with a huge range of diverse, highly talented scientists across the globe,
  * You are UK based and have the right to work in the UK,
  * We offer flexible working arrangements, but you will be expected to be able to spend at least 3 days per week in our office located in Macclesfield town centre, Cheshire.

  Other bonus (but certainly not required!) experience:

  * Experience in working in interdisciplinary and cross-cultural environments

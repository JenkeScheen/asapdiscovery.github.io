summary: |
  The development of novel, low cost and globally available antiviral therapeutics remains an essential goal for the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Furthermore, future pandemics could be prevented with easily deployable broad spectrum oral antivirals and open knowledge bases that de-risk and accelerate novel antiviral discovery and development.

  Structure-enabled drug design and fragment-based drug discovery have made significant contributions to the development of these much-needed antivirals with over 2,000 X-ray crystal structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank to date. Facilities like the XChem fragment screening platform at Diamond have enabled efforts such as the COVID Moonshot â€“ a fully open-science structure-enabled drug discovery campaign targeting the SARS-CoV-2 main protease that developed a pre-clinical candidate targeting the SARS-CoV-2 Main protease in less than 2 years.

  As part of a new NIH funded Antiviral Drug Discovery (AViDD) Center for Pathogens of Pandemic Concern we are seeking to recruit enthusiastic crystallographers, technicians, informaticians and a research coordinator to deliver high-throughput fragment screening experiments and rapid structural support for hit-to-lead development of novel inhibitors targeting SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses. The appointed people will work closely with the XChem and I04-1 teams as well as an international collection of collaborators.

  In this role, you will:

  * Be responsible for delivering successful crystallographic (XChem) fragment screens and rapid turn-around of protein-ligand crystal structures to enable hit-to-lead development.
  * Ensure all crystal structures are promptly available, at high quality and fully annotated, in the public domain.
  * Develop and test new and existing methodologies to increase the throughput of the XChem platform.
  * Report to the project supervisor, you will contribute to the on-going research within the group.
  * Be responsible for carrying out work to fulfil the aims of the research proposal detailed in the Job Description appendix.
  * Manage the day-to-day running of a research project.
  * Identify research objectives and carry out appropriate research activities within a given timescale.
  * Attend internal scientific and administrative meetings with scientific collaborators.
  * Lead in the analysis and authoring of scientific results in international peer-reviewed journals.
  * Keep up with latest results and international research directions, especially in interest for the research project associated with this post.

  About you

  You will have an appropriate Science Degree (Biochemistry/Chemistry/Chemical Biology) and an appropriate PhD together with proven relevant experience. You will also need to be able to communicate and interact with staff on all levels with good organisation skills and the ability to work flexibly. First-hand experience in crystallographic fragment screening and compound development is highly desirable.

  The successful candidate will likely have:
  * An interest in protein crystallography and drug discovery, particularly fragment-based drug discovery or structure-based drug design
  * Strong analytical skills and excellent record keeping
  * Good organisational and time management skills

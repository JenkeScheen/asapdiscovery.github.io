summary: |
  The development of novel, low cost and globally available antiviral therapeutics remains an essential goal for the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Furthermore, future pandemics could be prevented with easily deployable broad spectrum oral antivirals and open knowledge bases that de-risk and accelerate novel antiviral discovery and development.

  Structure-enabled drug design and fragment-based drug discovery have made significant contributions to the development of these much-needed antivirals with over 2,000 X-ray crystal structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank to date. Facilities like the XChem fragment screening platform at Diamond have enabled efforts such as the COVID Moonshot â€“ a fully open-science structure-enabled drug discovery campaign targeting the SARS-CoV-2 main protease that developed a pre-clinical candidate targeting the SARS-CoV-2 Main protease in less than 2 years.

  As part of a new NIH funded Antiviral Drug Discovery (AViDD) Center for Pathogens of Pandemic Concern we are seeking to recruit enthusiastic crystallographers, technicians, informaticians and a research coordinator to deliver high-throughput fragment screening experiments and rapid structural support for hit-to-lead development of novel inhibitors targeting SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses. The appointed people will work closely with the XChem and I04-1 teams as well as an international collection of collaborators.

  In this role, you will:
  * Provide general laboratory support to the XChem facility and upkeep the operation of equipment.
  * Assist with the delivery of successful crystallographic (XChem) fragment screens and rapid turn-around of protein-ligand crystal structures.
  * Contribute to the development and testing of new and existing methodologies to increase the throughput of the XChem platform.
  * Reporting to the project supervisor, you will contribute to the on-going research within the group.
  * Keep up with latest results and international research directions, especially in interest for the research project associated with this post.

  About you

  You will have an appropriate Science Degree and an appropriate PhD together with proven relevant experience. You will also need to be able to communicate and interact with staff on all levels with good organisation skills and the ability to work flexibly. Experience in fragment-based drug discovery will be advantageous.

  The successful candidate will likely have:
  * An interest in high-throughput protein crystallography and fragment-based drug discovery
  * Excellent organisational and time management skills
  * Good laboratory practice

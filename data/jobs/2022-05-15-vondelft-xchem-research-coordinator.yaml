summary: |
  The development of novel, low cost and globally available antiviral therapeutics remains an essential goal for the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Furthermore, future pandemics could be prevented with easily deployable broad spectrum oral antivirals and open knowledge bases that de-risk and accelerate novel antiviral discovery and development.

  Structure-enabled drug design and fragment-based drug discovery have made significant contributions to the development of these much-needed antivirals with over 2,000 X-ray crystal structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank to date. Facilities like the XChem fragment screening platform at Diamond have enabled efforts such as the COVID Moonshot – a fully open-science structure-enabled drug discovery campaign targeting the SARS-CoV-2 main protease that developed a pre-clinical candidate targeting the SARS-CoV-2 Main protease in less than 2 years.

  As part of a new NIH funded Antiviral Drug Discovery (AViDD) Center for Pathogens of Pandemic Concern we are seeking to recruit enthusiastic crystallographers, technicians, informaticians and a research coordinator to deliver high-throughput fragment screening experiments and rapid structural support for hit-to-lead development of novel inhibitors targeting SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses. The appointed people will work closely with the XChem and I04-1 teams as well as an international collection of collaborators.

  A scientific coordinator PDRA with background in drug discovery, biochemistry or chemistry, will be tasked with implementing and delivering scientific project management, exploiting Diamond’s processes for technical projects. This role is crucial in view of the many contributors involved in delivering even one enabled target, a lesson adopted from the Wellcome-funded TEP grant (2015-2020) in Oxford.  Scientific expertise is crucial, as the role encompasses dissemination of outputs, including capturing Project 2 outcomes in scientific papers.

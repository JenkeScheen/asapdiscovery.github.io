summary: |
  The development of novel, low cost and globally available antiviral therapeutics remains an essential goal for the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Furthermore, future pandemics could be prevented with easily deployable broad spectrum oral antivirals and open knowledge bases that de-risk and accelerate novel antiviral discovery and development.

  Structure-enabled drug design and fragment-based drug discovery have made significant contributions to the development of these much-needed antivirals with over 2,000 X-ray crystal structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank to date. Facilities like the XChem fragment screening platform at Diamond have enabled efforts such as the COVID Moonshot â€“ a fully open-science structure-enabled drug discovery campaign targeting the SARS-CoV-2 main protease that developed a pre-clinical candidate targeting the SARS-CoV-2 Main protease in less than 2 years.

  As part of a new NIH funded Antiviral Drug Discovery (AViDD) Center for Pathogens of Pandemic Concern we are seeking to recruit enthusiastic crystallographers, technicians, informaticians and a research coordinator to deliver high-throughput fragment screening experiments and rapid structural support for hit-to-lead development of novel inhibitors targeting SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses. The appointed people will work closely with the XChem and I04-1 teams as well as an international collection of collaborators.

  A computational chemistry PDRA will be responsible for driving and completing first round follow-up of all XChem screening campaigns. This will entail performing the computational and intellectual work for designing and finalising lists of candidate compounds; sourcing them from vendors, in particular Enamine, assisted by Center partner PostEra; and designing and executing the robot-based synthesis experiments already being developed at Diamond in partnership with the Rosalind Franklin Institute and the EUbOPEN IMI2 project. The tapered effort reflects the tapered outputs envisioned for Project 2; the person will at that point be assigned to additional projects, and co-funded accordingly.

summary: |
  A Postdoctoral Associate position is immediately available in the Microbiology Department in the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in the laboratory of Dr. Kris M. White as part of a multi-disciplinary program focused on the development of clinic-ready orally-bioavailable antiviral drugs for the treatment of viruses with pandemic potential, particularly influenza A virus, picornaviruses, flaviviruses, and coronaviruses. The goal of the project is to develop effective antiviral drugs that can be deployed at the earliest stages of the next viral pandemic, with the potential of saving millions of lives. This position will be focused on using high throughput screening approaches, animal models for antiviral development, and advanced approaches to analyze antiviral resistance patterns using next generation sequencing methods. The person filling this position will play an important intellectual, technical, and scientific role in leading these projects. Position is supported by NIH funding through Antiviral Drug Discovery (AViDD) centers.

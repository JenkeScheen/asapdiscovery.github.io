The **Open Force Field Consortium** is composed of academic investigators from the Open Force Field Initiative and sponsoring Industry Partners collaborating to advance open force field science, toolkits, and standards for biomolecular drug discovery.

**The [Open Force Field Consortium officially launched](https://openforcefield.org/news/introducing-the-consortium/) on Oct 1, 2018,** but there is still room to join or get involved.

**Industry Partners:** Bayer, BASF, Boehringer-Ingelheim, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Cresset, GlaxoSmithKline, Janssen, Merck KGaA, OpenEye, Pfizer, Qulab, Roche, Vertex Pharmaceuticals, XtalPi

## The Consortium uses a collaborative, shared-governance model

Consortium members *partner* to advance force fields. Thus, the Consortium is a true collaboration, not just a funding initiative. Industry partners often have tremendous expertise in the strengths and weaknesses of force fields and the Initiative can greatly benefit from their expertise. Thus, our seven-member Governing Board includes elected representatives from supporting Partners who help plan our science. Additionally, we have an extensive Advisory Board including members from all Partners that contribute above a threshold level of support. This board provides input on scientific directions and project plans, and elects industry representatives to the Governing Board. Both boards are involved in regular calls and meetings with the Principal Investigators as part of the Initiative.

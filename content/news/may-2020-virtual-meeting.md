We are hosting the Third [Open Force Field Consortium](https://openforcefield.org/consortium/) Workshop, this time in the online world of Zoom, on May 4-5, 2020. This virtual meeting is replacing the planned in-person gathering in Boston. We decided to slightly experiment with the workshop format by making most of the content available before the meeting for asynchronous consumption. Namely, all talks will be pre-recorded and the meeting time will be focused on discussions around those talks and future planning. T[David Cerutti](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-cerutti-11321129), who has recently joined the Open Force Field Initiative as a senior scientist and who will lead the NIH-funded efforts in the biopolymer arena, will give a virtual keynote and a brief summary of his talk before discussion. The main aim of this format is to make this virtual meeting more interactive, and hopefully, more productive.  

#### Talks and discussions

The meeting attendees can join the recording sessions, if they wish, or watch the videos later at their own convenience. Each talk will be 15 min long and there will be 15 min for questions and comments. Read in the Zoom policy below how to join the meetings.

The talks will be uploaded to our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCh0aJSUm_sYr7nuTzhW806g/featured) on the day when they are recorded. The recording session schedule is provided below and the YouTube links and slides will be shared as soon as the videos have been uploaded. To access presentation slides and better video quality, download provided content from Zenodo.

Discussion session schedule is in preparation and it will be posted soon, but one of the planned discussions will be focused on user experience. To help us understand better your needs and your use cases, please respond to this [survey](https://forms.gle/5AEbFvHH9wVqnigh7).

#### Zoom policy

The schedule for recording sessions and discussions will be available on the website, however, the Zoom links and passwords will be shared via email with all registered participants. This is a precautionary measure to reduce the probability of Zoom bombing. If any of your colleagues or collaborators would like to join the meeting, please ask them to register here with their institutional email account. All Zoom meetings have the waiting room enabled.

#### Registration

The meeting is primarily intended for the members of the Open Force Field Consortium and Initiative, but all talks and some parts of the meeting are open to the interested members of the community. Please register with your institutional email using the form below (if you use your personal email account you may risk not receiving meeting details). Please note that some discussions might not be open to general public.

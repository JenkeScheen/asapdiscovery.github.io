# Scientific Advisory Board

The Scientific Advisory Board provides valuable input to help guide the Open Force Field Initiative toward the most relevant engineering and science efforts that will empower members of the biomolecular simulation and force field development communities.
The Board convenes two virtual meetings per year to advise on various aspects of the overall Initiative and receives invitations to join our two in-person meetings per year.

The current Scientific Advisory Board consists of scientists engaged within the force field development and biomolecular simulation software communities:
